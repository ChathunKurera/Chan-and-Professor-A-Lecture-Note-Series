Known mistakes:

"For your derivation of a line you've got a small mistake at the end. Since you didn't integrate from -L/2 to L/2 (that's fine), you can't just sub y=L/2 in your final equation. The part that you have circled should be multiplied by 2, canceling the 2 on top getting you the eqn L/sqrt(...etc)."
