Known mistakes in Winter 2008 Final (Should actually be labelled Fall 2008, I just saw December and wrote Winter out of habit lol): 

Question 1c) Angle at w = infinity should be -180 degrees because each of the imaginary poles provides a phase of 90 degrees. The correct plot has the direction in the reverse from what's drawn.

Question 3) I SWITCHED THE ORDER OF THE POLES AND ZEROS BY ACCIDENT

It should be (s+0.1786)/(s+1.6875), not the other way around. I'll leave you guys to do the re-calculation of error and shit yourselves, that stuff is pretty straight forward.
