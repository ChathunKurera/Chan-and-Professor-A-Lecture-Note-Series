# Chan-and-Professor-A-Lecture-Note-Series
A public repository of all the course notes/summaries/etc I've written.

Feel free to distribute the stuff I have in here, just make sure to link back to me and give me a star :) The biggest thank you, however, would be to try to do something similar for your own class. Everyone has courses they're good at, and everyone has courses they're shit at. ECE is hard enough, help out your fellow classmates if it's within your abilities to.
